        <h1>Ego and Identity by Jann</h1>
        
        <p>" Your ego is your conscious mind, the part of your identity that you consider your "self." If you say someone has "a big ego," then you are saying he is too full of himself."
</p>
        
        <p>"Your identity is what makes you "you." If you are having "an identity crisis," then I guess you can't figure out who you are."</p>
